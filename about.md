Nur Muhammad Bin Sirat finds joy in the little things. That's why **Ruby**, the language which professes *programmer happiness*, is his language of choice. When not hacking on millions of his unfinished side projects, he can be seen roaming for food with his wife and two children, his two cats in tow.

He is currently employed as a Software Consultant at [Mavericks Consulting](https://mavericks-consulting.com).

Say hi on [twitter](https://twitter.com/geekmat), or drop him a note at mat [dot] ace [at] gmail [dot] com.
