I was looking at some legacy Ruby code today and saw that there was a bunch of instance variables being created inside a class method. In fact, the whole class is littered with `def self.foo` declarations; nothing except class methods. There was an even funky statement at the top of the class.

```Ruby
class Foo
  class << self
    attr_reader :instance_var_1, :instance_var_2, :instance_var_3
  end

  ...

end
```

Needless to say, I was intrigued. Who would write Ruby code this way? What was the intent and motivation? Was it laziness or awesomeness? Was there some intricacies of Ruby that I was not aware of? That must be it. Faced with something I know I don't know, naturally, I wanted to experiment. Off to the REPL I say..

```Ruby
class Foo
  def bar=(val)
    @bar = val
  end

  def bar
    @bar
  end
end
```

So I created my own dummy class to work with. Standard enough getter/setter but using a class method.

```Ruby
Foo.bar = "hello world"
=> "hello world"

Foo.bar
=> "hello world"
```

Works as expected. Now to unknown territory.

```Ruby
a = Foo.new
=> #<Foo:0x007f95ab80d5e8>

b = Foo.new
=> #<Foo:0x007f95aa17e688>

a == b
=> false
```

Again, as expected.

```Ruby
a.class.bar
=> "hello world"

b.class.bar
=> "hello world"
```

Expected.

```Ruby
a.class.bar = 12345
=> 12345
```

So what happens when I call #bar from b?

```Ruby
b.class.bar
=> 12345
```

Interesting! Since Foo is an instance of Class, the instance variable @bar lives on that instance. Any sub-instances we create from Foo and then subsequently attempt to access @bar will look at the same reference.

So what is the moral of the story? It should be OK to use instance variables in class methods, but hope to God that the class is will not be instantiated. Or else information could be leaked and shared across instances, potentially leading to some subtle bug somewhere.
